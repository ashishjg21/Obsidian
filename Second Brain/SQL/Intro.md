# Introduction toÂ SQL
## What is SQL?

-   SQL stands for Structured Query Language
-   SQL lets you access and manipulate databases


To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

-   An RDBMS database program (i.e. MS Access, SQL Server, MySQL)
-   To use a server-side scripting language, like PHP or ASP
-   To use SQL to get the data you want
-   To use HTML / CSS to style the page

## RDBMS
MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft Access

A record, also called a row, is each individual entry that exists in a table. For example, there are 91 records in the above Customers table. A record is a horizontal entity in a table.

A column is a vertical entity in a table that contains all information associated with a specific field in a table.
