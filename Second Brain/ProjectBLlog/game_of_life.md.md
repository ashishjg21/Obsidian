Game of Life (or just “Life”) is not really a game. There’s no winning or losing or destroying your opponent mentally and spiritually. Life is a “cellular automaton” - a system of cells that live on a grid, where they live, die and evolve according to the rules that govern their world.

The cell then updates its own liveness according to 4 rules:

1.  Any live cell with 0 or 1 live neighbors becomes dead, because of underpopulation
2.  Any live cell with 2 or 3 live neighbors stays alive, because its neighborhood is just right
3.  Any live cell with more than 3 live neighbors becomes dead, because of overpopulation
4.  Any dead cell with exactly 3 live neighbors becomes alive, by reproduction
