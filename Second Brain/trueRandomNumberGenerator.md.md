Random numbers in computer science is used for cryptography, simulation, sampling, design and games. In the past the need for more and more randomness has increased. Developers seek for more and more randomness. This project is based on generating random numbers using simple programming on a local system.

**Features** 

The source of randomness available to a personal computer like laptops includes:   
 

-   The surrounding light and scene
-   The surrounding sound or noise
-   The TCP information for the network
-   The RTT of a specific network, dependent on the congestion of the network
-   System time
-   Scheduling delay over core or multicores
