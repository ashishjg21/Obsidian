### 1. What are the different data types present in C++?

The 4 data types in C++ are given below:

-   Primitive Datatype(basic datatype). Example- char, short, int, float, long, double, bool, etc.
-   Derived datatype. Example- array, pointer, etc.
-   Enumeration. Example- enum
-   User-defined data types. Example- structure, class, etc.


C is a procedure-oriented programming language.
C++ is an object-oriented programming language.

**Operator Overloading** is a very essential element to perform the operations on user-defined data types. By operator overloading we can modify the default meaning to the operators like +, -, *, /, <=, etc.

A **friend class** can access private, protected, and public members of other classes in which it is declared as friends.

If a function is **inline** , the compiler places a copy of the code of that function at each point where the function is called at compile time. One of the important advantages of using an inline function is that it eliminates the function calling overhead of a traditional function.

A **reference** is like a pointer. It is another name of an already existing variable. Once a reference name is initialized with a variable, that variable can be accessed by the variable name or reference name both.

### What is an abstract class and when do you use it?
A class is called an abstract class whose objects can never be created. Such a class exists as a parent for the derived classes. We can make a class abstract by placing a pure virtual function in the class.
